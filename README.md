## Craft your own shirt using AI and a variety of customizations tools

The process of creating a shirt can be long and hard. Shirt AI makes this process much easier by allowing you to craft a t shirt in just 4 easy steps.

## Features in this app include

* Shirt color selection
* Logo creation via AI prompt or file upload
* Editing of logo with scale, crop, and rotation
* Shirt name editor
* edit font family font size, font weight, text color, letter spacing, rotation, and text shadow
* Downloading of custom logo or shirt

## Tutorial
* The create shirt section serves as a preview of what the generated shirt may look like. The shirt may not always come as expected.
* When creating a shirt there are three main steps that you will see: choose a color, choose a logo, and choose a name.
* choosing a logo and name is optional.
* When choosing a logo you have the choice of uploading one yourself or generating one using ai.
* To generate with AI type into the text area and press enter.
* To upload an image press the upload button and add an image from your computer.
* If you upload a logo you must describe what the logo is in simple terms so the AI can generate it later.
* If you choose to have a name on your shirt make the name brief.
* If the shirt you viewed is to your liking, download it and go to the links provided to have it printed. Otherwise restart the create shirt process.
